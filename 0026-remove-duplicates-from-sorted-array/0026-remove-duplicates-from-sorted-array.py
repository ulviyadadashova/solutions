### **Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   L = 1
   ```
   - **Purpose:** 
     - `L` is used to keep track of the position where the next unique element should be placed in the `nums` list. It starts from `1` because the first element is always unique.

2. **Traverse the List:**
   ```python
   for R in range(1, len(nums)):
   ```
   - **Purpose:**
     - `R` is the current index being processed. We start from `1` because we compare each element with the previous one (`R - 1`).

3. **Check for Uniqueness:**
   ```python
   if nums[R] != nums[R - 1]:
   ```
   - **Purpose:**
     - This condition checks if the current element (`nums[R]`) is different from the previous element (`nums[R - 1]`). If they are different, it means `nums[R]` is a unique element that should be included in the list of unique elements.

4. **Update Unique Elements:**
   ```python
   nums[L] = nums[R]
   L += 1
   ```
   - **Purpose:**
     - If the current element is unique, it is placed at the position `L` in the `nums` list.
     - Move the pointer `L` to the next position to prepare for the next unique element.

5. **Return the Length:**
   ```python
   return L
   ```
   - **Purpose:**
     - Return `L`, which represents the length of the array with all unique elements. This effectively gives the number of unique elements in the modified list.

### **Example Walkthrough:**

For `nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]`:

- **Initial state:** `L = 1`
- **Iteration 1:** `R = 1`, `nums[1] = 1`, `nums[0] = 1` (Not unique, skip)
- **Iteration 2:** `R = 2`, `nums[2] = 2`, `nums[1] = 1` (Unique)
  - Update `nums[1] = 2`
  - Increment `L` to `2`
- **Iteration 3:** `R = 3`, `nums[3] = 2`, `nums[2] = 2` (Not unique, skip)
- **Iteration 4:** `R = 4`, `nums[4] = 3`, `nums[3] = 2` (Unique)
  - Update `nums[2] = 3`
  - Increment `L` to `3`
- **Iteration 5:** `R = 5`, `nums[5] = 4`, `nums[4] = 3` (Unique)
  - Update `nums[3] = 4`
  - Increment `L` to `4`
- **Iteration 6:** `R = 6`, `nums[6] = 4`, `nums[5] = 4` (Not unique, skip)

**Result:** The list will be modified to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, and the length of unique elements is `4`.

**Output:** `4`

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. We traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are modifying the list in place without using extra space.'''

Brute-Force Solution:

"To solve the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array, the brute-force approach would involve creating a new array and iterating through the original array, adding each element to the new array only if it is not already present. We would do this by checking every element against all the previous elements in the new array to ensure there are no duplicates.

For example, if we have an array [1, 1, 2, 3, 3], we would start with an empty array and add the first 1. Then, when we encounter the second 1, we would check if it's already in the new array. Since it is, we skip it. We then add 2 because it's not in the new array, and so on."

Why the Brute-Force Solution is Inefficient:

"This brute-force method is inefficient because it involves multiple comparisons for each element. Specifically, for each element, we might end up comparing it to all the elements that have been added to the new array. In the worst case, this results in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This quadratic time complexity is not ideal, especially for larger arrays."

Optimal Solution:

"Now, let's move on to the optimal solution, which leverages the fact that the array is already sorted. We can solve the problem in O(n) time by modifying the array in place. Here's how:

We initialize a pointer L to 1 (the second element) because the first element is always unique.
We then iterate through the array using another pointer R, starting from the second element.
For each element at index R, we compare it with the previous element. If it's different, it means it's a unique element. We then place this unique element at the position L and increment L to move to the next position.
By the end of the iteration, L will point to the position after the last unique element. Thus, the length of the array without duplicates is L.
This approach only requires a single pass through the array and modifies the array in place, resulting in a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1)."'''
