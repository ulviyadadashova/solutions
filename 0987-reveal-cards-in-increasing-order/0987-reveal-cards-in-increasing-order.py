### **Explanation:**

The problem is to simulate the process of revealing a deck of cards in increasing order, such that when the deck is fully revealed, the cards are in ascending order. The solution involves sorting the deck and simulating the reverse process of revealing the cards.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Sort the Deck:**
   ```python
   deck.sort()
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Sorting the deck ensures that the cards are in ascending order, which is essential for reconstructing the sequence.

2. **Initialize Deque:**
   ```python
   q = deque()
   ```
   - **Purpose:** The deque (`q`) is used to simulate the revealing process in reverse.

3. **Process the Deck in Reverse Order:**
   ```python
   for card in reversed(deck):
       if q:
           q.appendleft(q.pop())  # Move the last element to the front
       q.appendleft(card)  # Place the current card at the front
   ```
    For each card, if the deque is not empty, we move the last card to the front (simulating the action of placing the top card at the bottom).
    We then insert the current card at the front, ensuring that the final revealed order matches the required increasing order.
   - **Purpose:** 
     - **Reverse Processing:** By processing the sorted deck in reverse order, we simulate the revealing process.
     - **Rearrange the Deque:** 
       - If the deque is not empty, move the last element to the front (`q.appendleft(q.pop())`).
       - Then, add the current card to the front of the deque (`q.appendleft(card)`).
     - This step effectively recreates the sequence in which the cards would have been revealed to achieve an increasing order.
    By processing the deck in reverse and simulating the revealing process, we ensure that the final sequence matches the sorted order of the cards, effectively reconstructing the deck to achieve the desired revealing sequence.
4. **Convert Deque to List:**
   ```python
   return list(q)
   ```
   - **Purpose:** The final deque is converted back to a list to produce the result.

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting of the deck.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the deque used to simulate the process.

This solution effectively reconstructs the required order of cards that would result in the deck being revealed in increasing order.'''

Brute-Force Approach:

To solve this problem using a brute-force approach, we would start by generating all possible permutations of the deck. For each permutation, we would simulate the revealing process to check if it results in the sorted order of cards. This involves repeatedly moving the top card to the bottom of the deck and then comparing the revealed sequence to the sorted order.

This brute-force method is inefficient because the number of permutations grows factorially with the number of cards, which leads to an impractically high number of simulations for large decks. As a result, the time complexity of this approach is factorial, making it infeasible for decks with more than a few cards.

Optimal Approach:

The optimal solution leverages the fact that we can reconstruct the deck in reverse to ensure the correct revealing order. First, sort the deck in ascending order. Then, use a deque to simulate the revealing process in reverse.

We process the sorted deck from end to beginning. For each card, move the last element of the deque to the front, simulating the reverse of the revealing process. Then, add the current card to the front of the deque. By the end of this process, the deck is reconstructed to match the required order.

The time complexity of this approach is O of n log n due to the sorting step, where n is the number of cards. The space complexity is O of n because we use additional space for the deque. This approach efficiently constructs the deck in the correct order, making it feasible even for larger decks.'''
