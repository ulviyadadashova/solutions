### **Explanation:**

**Problem:**
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n` representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. Merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array. The array `nums1` has a size of `m + n` to accommodate the elements of `nums2`.

**Steps:**

1. **While Loop to Merge Elements:**
   ```python
   while m > 0 and n > 0:
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Iterate as long as there are elements to merge from both `nums1` and `nums2`.
   - **How It Works:** This loop ensures that we keep comparing the elements from the end of both arrays.

2. **Compare Elements and Place the Larger One:**
   ```python
   if nums1[m-1] >= nums2[n-1]:
       nums1[m+n-1] = nums1[m-1]
       m -= 1
   else:
       nums1[m+n-1] = nums2[n-1]
       n -= 1
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Compare the elements from the back of `nums1` and `nums2`.
   - **How It Works:** 
     - If `nums1[m-1]` is greater or equal, it is placed in the correct position in `nums1`, and `m` is decremented.
     - If `nums2[n-1]` is greater, it is placed in the correct position, and `n` is decremented.

3. **Handle Remaining Elements in nums2:**
   ```python
   if n > 0:
       nums1[:n] = nums2[:n]
   ```
   - **Purpose:** If `nums2` still has elements left after the loop, place them at the beginning of `nums1`.
   - **How It Works:** This step is necessary because if `m` reaches `0` before `n`, all remaining elements in `nums2` should be placed at the start of `nums1`.

### **Example Walkthrough:**

Suppose you have:
- `nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]`, `m = 3`
- `nums2 = [2, 5, 6]`, `n = 3`

1. **Iteration 1:**
   - `nums1[2] = 3` vs. `nums2[2] = 6`
   - Place `6` at `nums1[5]`.
   - `nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 6]`, `n = 2`

2. **Iteration 2:**
   - `nums1[2] = 3` vs. `nums2[1] = 5`
   - Place `5` at `nums1[4]`.
   - `nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 6]`, `n = 1`

3. **Iteration 3:**
   - `nums1[2] = 3` vs. `nums2[0] = 2`
   - Place `3` at `nums1[3]`.
   - `nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6]`, `m = 2`

4. **Remaining elements in nums2:**
   - Place `2` at the beginning.
   - `nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]`

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m + n)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. We process each element exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as the merging is done in-place within `nums1`.'''

'''

1. **Brute-Force Approach**:
   - First, you could mention that a straightforward brute-force solution would involve merging the two arrays by first creating a new array that combines both `nums1` and `nums2`.
   - You would then sort this new array to get the merged result.
   - After sorting, you would copy the elements back into `nums1`.

   **Time Complexity**: O((m + n) log(m + n)), where m and n are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively, due to sorting. 
   
   **Space Complexity**: O(m + n) for the additional array used to store the combined elements.

2. **Optimal Solution**:
   - Explain that the optimal approach involves merging the arrays in-place. Start from the end of `nums1` and `nums2` and compare their elements.
   - Use a while loop to place the larger element at the end of `nums1` and adjust pointers accordingly.
   - Once the loop is done, if there are remaining elements in `nums2`, copy them to the start of `nums1`.

   **Time Complexity**: O(m + n) because each element is processed once.
   
   **Space Complexity**: O(1) because the merging is done in-place within `nums1`.
